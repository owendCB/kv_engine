/**
 * A container for data structures that are used in the algorithm for
 * selecting which documents to evict from the hash table.
 *
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * Each time a value is referenced in the hash table its frequency count
 * is incremented according to an 8 bit statistical counter.  The counter
 * behaviour is such that as the frequency increases (towards a maximum of
 * 255) it becomes increasingly harder to increment.  It is configured so
 * that a value must be referenced approximately 65K times before its
 * frequency count becomes saturated.
 *
 * During eviction we visit each item in the hash and build up a histogram of
 * frequency counts of the values.  So we have a sum of how many values have
 * a frequency count of 0,  how many have a frequency count of 1, ... how
 * many have a frequency of 255.
 *
 * We have a method getFreqThreshold(uint8_t percentage) which is applied to
 * the histogram and returns the frequency count that corresponds to the
 * given percentile.  For example, if called with 5%, it would return the
 * lowest frequency count that accounts for 5% of all the values added to the
 * histogram.
 *
 * Once we have obtained this threshold frequency count, we simply continue
 * iterating over the hash table and evict all those values that have a
 * frequency count at or below the threshold.
