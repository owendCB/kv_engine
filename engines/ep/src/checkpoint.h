 * (queue_op::mutation), or one of a range of meta-items
 * (queue_op::checkpoint_start, queue_op::checkpoint_end, ...).
 *
 * A checkpoint may either be Open or Closed. Open checkpoints can still have
 * new items appended to them, whereas Closed checkpoints cannot (and are
 * logically immutable). A checkpoint begins life as an Open checkpoint, will
 * have items added to it (including de-duplication if a key is added which
 * already exists), and then once large/old enough it will be marked as Closed,
 * and a new Open checkpoint created for new items.
 *
 * Consumers read items from Checkpoints by creating a CheckpointCursor
 * (similar to an STL iterator), which they use to mark how far along the
 * Checkpoint they are.

 *
 * A Checkpoint starts with an empty item, followed by a checkpoint_start,
 * and then 0...N set and del items, finally finishing with a checkpoint_end if
 * the Checkpoint is closed.
 * The empty item exists because Checkpoints are structured such that
 * CheckpointCursors are advanced _before_ dereferencing them, not _after_
 * (this differs from STL iterators which are typically incremented after
 * dereferencing them) - i.e. the pseudo-code for reading elements is:
 *
 *     getElements(CheckpointCursor& cur) {
 *         std::vector<...> result;
 *         while (incrCursorAndCheckValid(cur) {
 *             result.push_back(*cur);
 *         };
 *         return result;
 *     }
 *
 * As such we need to have a dummy element at the start of each Checkpoint, so
 * after the first call to CheckpointManager::incrCursor() the cursor
 * dereferences to the checkpoint_start element.
 *
 * Note that sequence numbers are only unique for normal operations (mutation)
 * and system events - for meta-items like checkpoint start/end they share the
 * same sequence number as the associated op - for checkpoint_start that is the
 * ID of the following op, for checkpoint_end the ID of the proceeding op.
